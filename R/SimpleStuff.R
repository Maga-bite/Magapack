# The function to build a function is: function
# function (x,y), but we need graph parenthesis { } as is stating that inside the function something is happening
function(x,y) {
  z=x+y
  return(z)
  }
#the name should be the same as the title
SimpleStuff <- function(x,y) {
  z=x+y
  return(z)
  }
#to check if it works go to R and put it inside the function
#you can also assign these numbers to some variables and in this way, it is possible to use them in the function
#take home message: you can build your function, so open sources enable you to use others' function and improve them
